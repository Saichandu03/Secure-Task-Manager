# Postman — Quick Usage

Import `docs/postman_collection.json` into Postman and use the provided requests to test:

- Auth: Register, Login, Get Me
- Tasks: Create, List, Update, Delete

Notes

- The collection uses `http://localhost:5000`. Update the host/port if your backend runs elsewhere.
- Ensure Postman preserves cookies between requests so protected endpoints work.
